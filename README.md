# GTNH---Inferno-Mines

## Rules
* Standard rule from Garden of Grind apply: https://github.com/cubic-chariot/gtnh/blob/master/garden-of-grind.md
* Enable chunk claiming in ServerUtilities.cfg (tnt traps don't work as intended by map creator and deal massive damage in unclaimed chunks)
* /gamerule doMobSpawning false
* /gamerule mobGriefing false
* Dungeons are gated by tier. More information in the tier document.
* Complete as much significant progress as possible before advancing to the next tier. More information in each tier's goals.

## Additional Persnal Changes
* 1 diamond dolly spawned in. If I am going through the trouble of doing a challenge in a custom map for the payoff of building a base in a custom map, I don't want to deface the map to build early game mob farms.
