## Rules
* Standard rule from Garden of Grind apply: https://github.com/cubic-chariot/gtnh/blob/master/garden-of-grind.md
* Dungeons are gated by tier. More information is in the tier document in each map's folder.
* Complete as much significant progress as possible before advancing to the next tier. More information can be found in the tier document in each map's folder.
* /gamerule doMobSpawning false
* /gamerule mobGriefing false
* /gamerule keepInventory true


## Additional Personal Changes
* 1 diamond dolly spawned in. If I am going through the trouble of doing a challenge in a custom map for the payoff of building a base in a custom map, I don't want to deface the map to build early-game mob farms.

## Rational
First, why are we enforcing Garden of Grind rules onto a non-skyblock challenge? My reason for this is that I think it is a more interesting discussion to have to frame the custom maps in this context. You absolutely can play the custom maps in a world where new chunks can be generated. This means that to source new material, you would just have to leave the boundary of the map and generate new chunks, either in the overworld or in other dimensions. For me, the interesting discussion stops there as you could always just play standard GTNH. 

Second, why the extra rules? I like the idea of gating dungeons to tiers so that a playthrough of a map in GTNH is different from a vanilla playthrough. This also restricts certain resources to certain tiers, forcing the player to be creative in sourcing materials. The goal of completing as much significant progress as possible exists to further encourage the player to think outside the box with the resources they have available and can serve as a hint towards obscure paths towards progression.

Next, the confusing rules. The gamerules, at first glance, exist to make the game easier. Why would I require commands that make the game easier? Let's first consider doMobSpawning. In the early game of the Garden of Grind, mobs are a primary source of resources. Turning off natural spawning takes away this source, but only partially. This command only disables natural spawning so Mob Spawners, Open Blocks Graves, Spawn Eggs, and other forced summons still spawn monsters (other weird cases like lava monster spawns still work normally for whatever reason). This gamerule therefore makes the game (or at least the early game) drastically different from a standard Garden of Grind run and causes the early game of each map to look different from each other. There is one other implication of this rule that I would like to discuss and justify: the way that custom maps designed for combat play with natural spawns turned off. I freely admit that this changes the maps in a way that is far from what the map creator intended. I also admit that this makes the combat part of these maps easier to trivial throughout. However, I think that the puzzle that this rule creates far outweighs these undesirable consequences. To put this as simply as possible: if you want to play a map the way the map creator intended, then you should either play the map vanilla or with a different modpack better suited to combat.

Next with mobGriefing. Aside from me thinking that mob griefing is extremely annoying and doesn't add much challenge beyond breaking mob farms, this gamerule also severely nerfs gravel, dirt, and especially drowning creepers. Gravel and Dirt are still accessible by the mob's drop table
